# Planning Modes

There are 3 modes available in order to calculate the new count of the scaling-object:

- Constant Mode **(default mode)**
- Linear Mode
- Stepwise Mode

## Constant Mode

In this mode the CAP:

- Adds a constant offset to the current count of the scaling-object if an upscale is needed.
- Subtracts a constant offset to the current count of the scaling-object if an upscale is needed.

### Inputs

- `current_scale`: Current count of the scaling-object.
- `offset`: Config-Parameter.

### Calculation

- `planned_scale = current_scale + offset`

### Example

Start sokar with CAP in constant mode using an offset of 2 (scales n+2).
`./sokar --cap.constant-mode.enable --cap.constant-mode.offset=2`

## Linear Mode

In this mode the CAP scales linearly based on the current value of the `scaleFactor`. The value for adjusting the count is calculated by multiplying the current count of the scaling-object with the `scaleFactor`. This value is then added to the current count to calculate the "planned scale". This means if the `scaleFactor` is 1.0 the count of the scaling-object is increased by 100% (doubled).

Even if the current count is 0 the CAP will use an adjustment value of 0 in order to avoid starvation at a scale of 0.

To control a bit the impact of the `scaleFactor` on the planning the parameter `scaleFactorWeight` can be used. Internally the `scaleFactorWeight` and `scaleFactor` are multiplied.

### Inputs

- `current_scale`: Current count of the scaling-object.
- `scaleFactor`: Current steepness of the change of the incoming alert weights.
- `scaleFactorWeight`: Config-Parameter.

### Calculation

- `planned_scale = current_scale * (1 + scaleFactor * scaleFactorWeight)`

### Example

Start sokar with CAP in linear mode using a `scaleFactorWeight` of 0.7.
`./sokar --cap.constant-mode.enable=false --cap.linear-mode.enable --cap.linear-mode.scaleFactorWeight=0.7`

## Stepwise Mode
